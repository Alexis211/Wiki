Speech recognition will be vastly improved with a better microphone. In all cases, USB is strongly recommended.

Some recommendations:

  * Blue Yeti Nano (USB 3) - desktop, affordable and pretty good recognition. Can be attached to an arm for increased recognition. Useful if you're trying out speech recognition for the first time and don't want to spend a lot
  * DPA d:fine 4188 or 4288 (nearly equivalent) with a DPA d:vice interface - expensive but highly recommend for full time use

  * Stenomask - useful for open plan offices as it covers your mouth

### Eye Trackers

  * Tobii 4C is the most commonly used and recommended eye tracker. Talon also supports the Tobii PCEye Mini. Support for most 4th gen Tobii devices can be trivially added.
  * [Tobii 5](https://gaming.tobii.com/product/eye-tracker-5/) support coming soon.
